# AutoGithub
Automatically commit &amp; push updates to specified repositories when a defined threshold is met

See the repos.txt file for the formatting you should use to assign active repositories.

The first number in the config file is the threshold. I'm planning to implement a size threshold as an alternative option to just the timer
in the coming days, so every x amount of time your files would be scanned and if the size difference was met a commit would be created.

## This is obviously meant for personal projects, don't be lazy and use this in the workplace!
